 ---------------------------------------------------------- **INTRODUCTION** ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The project statement given to us was to clone the Decathlon website which deals in selling sports products. Our team was able to achieve as much as possible in the given time constraint with a few functionalities like product filtering based on certain categories, adding products in cart along with display of total price for all the products with variation in quantity.
